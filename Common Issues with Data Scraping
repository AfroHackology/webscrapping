Is it legal to do web scraping?

That depends on what you scrape and how you use scraped material.
We are not legally oriented so for accountable legal advice
please seek an attorney. Before that, we may give you a rough
idea of what's the right thing to do, please just fire us a contact ticket.

Many big web companies / university institutes scrape
for content / data by advice of law consultancy.
Some scraping activities do arouse legal issues.

However, many amateur scrapers do it in an illegal way,
such as scraping copyrighted articles or private data that's
restricted from being distributed. Even paragraphs or just a
few lines of them can make you qualified for a court summons
or DMCA penalty by Google.

However, scraping and keeping the data for private personal
uses only, you might be absolved of any copyright guilt.
So I'll keep away from copyright infringements, big deal!

Even if you are innocent of copyright infringements by
scraping only non-copyrighted / public domain works,
you may still be held liable for committing
trespass to chattels. What is safe to scrape then? I don't want any trouble.

With straight facts that cannot be copyrighted, web scraping of such content
is legal in the vast majority of cases as long as the data is broken
down in atmoic pieces and not in the original arrangement. For
instance, business information directory may be copyrighted
as a database but not so as broken pieces because they are straight facts.

Other than that, public domain works and non-copyrighted material
(such as works by people who have been dead for more than 70 years
and those released by the government) can be scraped and used
legally in any way possible.
